<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>This project is an open source project built by the Vienna Data Science Cafe Meet-Up members. </p>
<p>The goal, except for the obvious result, is to also use this project as a learning hub and as a research
    playground to build and test different Natural Language Processing models.</p>
<p>The Project status is still under development. You are very welcome to join the team in an upcoming edition of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Data-Science-Group-Meetup/">Vienna Data Science Cafe</a> or participate in the development on <a href="https://github.com/liadmagen/Keep-Current-Site">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The first 50 enrollers will become our alpha testers,
    so go ahead and register.</p>
<p>You will be notified when things are ready. </p>
