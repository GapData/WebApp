        <h4 class="display-5">Learning Intelligent Dialogs for Bounding Box Annotation</h4>
        <div>Ksenia Konyushkova, Jasper Uijlings, Christoph Lampert, Vittorio Ferrari</div>
        <section>
          We introduce Intelligent Annotation Dialogs for bounding box annotation. We train an agent to automatically choose a sequence
          of actions for a human annotator to produce a bounding box in a minimal amount of time. Specifically, we consider
          two actions: box verification, where the annotator verifies a box generated by an object detector, and manual box
          drawing. We explore two kinds of agents, one based on predicting the probability that a box will be positively
          verified, and the other based on reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that (1) our agents are able to learn efficient
          annotation strategies in several scenarios, automatically adapting to the image difficulty, the desired quality
          of the boxes, and the detector strength; (2) in all scenarios the resulting annotation dialogs speed up annotation
          compared to manual box drawing alone and box verification alone, while also outperforming any fixed combination
          of verification and drawing in most scenarios; (3) in a realistic scenario where the detector is iteratively re-trained,
          our agents evolve a series of strategies that reflect the shifting trade-off between verification and drawing as
          the detector grows stronger.

        <h4 class="display-5">GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding</h4>
        <div>Alex Wang, Amapreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, Samuel R. Bowman</div>
        <section>
          For natural language understanding (NLU) technology to be maximally useful, both practically and as a scientific object of
          study, it must be general: it must be able to process language in a way that is not exclusively tailored to any
          one specific task or dataset. In pursuit of this objective, we introduce the General Language Understanding Evaluation
          benchmark (GLUE), a tool for evaluating and analyzing the performance of models across a diverse range of existing
          NLU tasks. GLUE is model-agnostic, but it incentivizes sharing knowledge across tasks because certain tasks have
          very limited training data. We further provide a hand-crafted diagnostic test suite that enables detailed linguistic
          analysis of NLU models. We evaluate baselines based on current methods for multi-task and transfer learning and
          find that they do not immediately give substantial improvements over the aggregate performance of training a separate
          model per task, indicating room for improvement in developing general and robust NLU systems.
